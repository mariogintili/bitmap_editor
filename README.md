# Bitmap editor

Please find in this repository my submission for the bitmap editor challenge.

## Installation requirements

- Ruby 2.2.3
- Bundler

## Installation

- `$ git clone git@github.com:mariogintili/bitmap_editor.git`
- `$ git checkout submission/mario-gintili`
- `$ bundle install`

## Running the test suite

`$ bundle exec rspec`

## Notes on the submission

- I didn't accounted for scrupulous input validation. i,e: checking all commands passed are known, have the right parameters, etc.
- I didn't had time to sit for the recommended time period in one day so I did the test across a couple of days.
